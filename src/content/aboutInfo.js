    "Iâ€™m a civil engineer turned junior front-end developer looking for an opportunity to learn industry best practices while building amazing projects. I am primarily focused on HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript using the React framework, but I am more than happy to learn new tools to excel at any task I am given. I believe in communicating frequently with team members and clients for greater transparency, trust, and accountability. If you're looking for somebody who values strong relationships and quality work, then I'd love for you to check out some of the projects I've built so far.",
