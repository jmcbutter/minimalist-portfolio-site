    "I was a civil engineer until I got my hands on my first programming book, at which point I discovered that I was more excited to build software than I ever was to build subdivisions. I eventually quit my engineering job so that I could put all of my focus into building amazing web projects. While I am primarily focused on HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript using the React framework, I am more than happy to learn new tools to complete any task I am given. I believe in communicating frequently with team members and clients for greater transparency, trust, and accountability. If you're looking for somebody who values strong relationships and quality work, then I'd love for you to check out some of the projects I've built so far.",
